WESNet Designs ContentDejour v 08.00.00 Installation

Minimum DotNetNuke Version: 08.00.01

Install the ContentDejour module into a working DotNetNuke installation as you would any other extension package:

1. Prior to beginning the installation of any downloaded zip archive, right click over the zip archive icon or filename in Windows Explorer then select "Properties"
from the context menu. If you see an "Unblock" button, click on it. This is necessary to prevent Windows security from blocking the extraction of certain
files that it considers "dangerous". These includes Javascript .js and Visual Basic .vb files.
2. Login as host user.
3. Navigate to Host --> Extensions page
4. Click on "Install Extension Wizard" button.
5. Click "Browse" and locate the WESNet.DNN.Modules.ContentDejour_08.00.00_Install.zip package that you have downloaded.
6. Click "Next" and follow all prompts.
